# Awesome Explanatory Ressources about Computation

This page contains a list of videos channels, books, articles and other
ressources that explain fundamental aspects of computation in easy to follow
terms. The ressources are similar to the `curiositas` project in spirit, but
not affiliated with it in any way.
The overarching theme is how computation works and how computation drives real
world systems, at least on the model-level humans use to make sense of the real
world. All ressources are in english language unless otherwise noted.
